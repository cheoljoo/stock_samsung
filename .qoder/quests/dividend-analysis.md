# Korean Dividend Analysis System Design

## 1. Overview

The Korean Dividend Analysis System is designed to identify and analyze companies with consistent dividend payments in the Korean stock market. The system focuses on finding companies that have maintained dividend payments for at least 5 consecutive years and provides comprehensive comparison capabilities between companies based on dividend rates, stock prices, and market capitalization.

### Current System Analysis

The existing codebase demonstrates sophisticated financial analysis capabilities with multiple variations of backtesting strategies, particularly focused on preferred stock vs common stock arbitrage for companies like Samsung Electronics. The system has evolved through multiple iterations, from simple 5-year analyses to comprehensive 30-year backtesting with sliding window approaches.

### Core Objectives

- Identify companies with 5+ consecutive years of dividend payments
- Create comprehensive comparison tables for investment decision-making
- Provide detailed analysis of dividend yields, stock performance, and market metrics
- Support both common and preferred stock analysis for comprehensive evaluation

### Dividend Consistency Analysis Algorithm

The system implements a sophisticated algorithm to identify companies with consistent dividend payments:

1. **Historical Data Collection**: Gather 10+ years of dividend data for comprehensive analysis
2. **Consecutive Year Detection**: Identify unbroken chains of annual dividend payments
3. **Payment Pattern Analysis**: Analyze quarterly/semi-annual payment consistency
4. **Growth Trend Evaluation**: Assess dividend growth sustainability

## 4. Core Features & Functionality

### Dividend Consistency Filter

**Primary Feature**: Identify companies with 5+ consecutive years of dividend payments

**Algorithm Components**:
- **Timeline Analysis**: Examine dividend payment history with gap detection
- **Payment Frequency Recognition**: Support quarterly, semi-annual, and annual patterns
- **Growth Rate Calculation**: Measure dividend growth consistency over time
- **Sustainability Assessment**: Evaluate financial health to predict future payments

### Financial Metrics Calculator

**Comprehensive Metrics Suite**:

| Metric Category | Specific Indicators |
